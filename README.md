# google-homepage

In this build for the Odin Project's HTML/CSS assignment (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css) I've created a static replica of Google's homepage.

Starting from blank .txt documents, I entered every key stroke of code myself. This is a very small project but a great starting point for me.

I'm excited to one day look back on this project and smile at how proud I was of something so simpleâ€”but it was my first simple thing that I created!
